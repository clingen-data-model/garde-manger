# Persistent ids in gene dosage structure

For every record in JIRA:
* An ISCA assertion that referrs to two assertions, triplosensitivity and haploinsufficiency
* Potentially six evidence lines, split between triplo and haplo assertions
* Each one is (thankfully) numbered, could be used as part of an assertion ID.
